Our case study is based on a computer hardware business which is facing challenges in dynamically changing market. Sales director decides to invest in data analysis project and he would like to build power BI dashboard that can give him real time sales insights. 

We will use AIMS grid to define purpose and success criteria of this project. 

Once AIMS grid is defined, next step is data discovery. In this step, data analyst team approaches the organization who owns software system that keep track of sales records. These records are stored in mysql database. Power BI can be plugged to this database to pull necessary information required for data analysis. I also discuss ETL, OLTP, OLAP and data warehouse concepts. Many times we need separate data warehouse or OLAP system to run our data analytics queries but in our project we will directly use mysql database.
